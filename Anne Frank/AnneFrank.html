        <h2>The Holocaust</h2>
        <p> The Holocaust was the systematic, bureaucratic, state-sponsored persecution and murder of six million Jews by the Nazi regime and its collaborators. The Nazis came to power in Germany in January 1933. They believed that Germans were "racially superior." They claimed that Jews were "inferior" and a threat to the so-called German racial community.</p>

        <h2>The Life of Anne Frank</h2>
        
<h4>In Time of Crisis</h4>
        <p> Born in the German city of Frankfurt am Main in 1929, Anne Frank had lived during the Holocaust. She was Jewish, therefore she never had a normal, happy childhood. Nevertheless, Frank focused on the good. She is most remembered for writing in her diary her thoughts, feelings, and short stories to distract her from the outside world. Little did she know that after her death, her diary would become world famous. Her book has been translated into around 70 languages and adapted for stage and screen. </p>

<h4> Influential </h4>
        <p>Frank is an influential figure to anyone who comes across her story. This is because even as a young Jewish girl living in times of desperation, she continued to keep a positive attitude. </p>

<h4> Secret Annex </h4>
        <p> In the spring of 1942, Anneâ€™s father had started furnishing a hiding place in the <a href="https://www.annefrank.org/en/anne-frank/secret-annex/"> annex </a> of his business premises at Prinsengracht 263. He received help from his former colleagues. Before long, they were joined by four more people. The hiding place was cramped. Anne had to keep very quiet and was often afraid. </p>
